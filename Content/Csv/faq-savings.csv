"<h3>Serious Saver MMA annual allowance</h3>
<p><img src=""mfxresource:library/savings.jpeg"" alt=""Savings""></p>
<p>&#160;You can&#160;contribute a maximum of $18,000&#160;<strong>in</strong>&#160;2016 if you are younger than 50 years old. If you are 50 or older, you&#160;<strong>can</strong>&#160;make an additional catch-up contribution of as<strong>much</strong>&#160;as $6,000, for a total of up to $24,000. Those contribution limits are scheduled to adjust&#160;<strong>annually</strong> in-line with inflation.</p>
<p>The old MMA system used to limit how much you could put into each pot - you'd either get half your allowance in cash and half in shares, or you could choose to put it all in shares.</p>
<p>But from since last July, the rules were almost completely relaxed. Although you still have a limit to the amount you can save - $18,000 from 6 April 2015 - you now get to choose how you split this between stocks &amp; shares and cash MMAs. You even get to choose whether you want to split it - if not, you can use the whole amount for stocks &amp; shares or the whole amount for cash.</p>","<h4>How you can split your ISA allowance:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use the maximum allowance for cash or investing.</strong>&#160;For the first time, you can put all the $18,000 in a cash MMA. Or, invest the whole lot in an investment MMA.</li>
<li><strong>Mix 'n' match.</strong>&#160;Split the allowance between cash and stocks &amp; shares ISAs. You get to choose!<br>If you wanted to, you could invest $1,500 in a cash MMA, and $15,740 in a stocks &amp; shares MMA. Or do it the other way around. The only rule is that, combined, your tax free MMA savings in the current tax year don't exceed $18,000.</li>
<li><strong>Have it all in one.</strong>&#160;Some stocks &amp; shares MMA providers may allow you to hold cash tax-free within your stocks &amp; shares MMA. But you're free to open separate accounts, as above, if you prefer.</li>
