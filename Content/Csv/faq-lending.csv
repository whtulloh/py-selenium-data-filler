"<p>A comparison rate is generated for each kind of personal loan we offer, it shows the interest rate for a selection of standard loan terms and amounts. This is important because these standard loan terms and amounts are used by other Banks and Lenders so that consumers can compare the products of different lenders over a wide variety of possible loan scenarios.</p>
<p>The comparison rate gives you an opportunity to compare the same standard loan amounts and loan terms from numerous credit providers. Comparison rate schedules are available at all Pluto branches and can be downloaded from our website.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of possible loan scenarios it is not practical to produce comparison rate schedules that cover every term and loan amount. As a result, the comparison rate you require may not be included in the schedule. Please use the closest comparison rate to your personal situation.</p>",,1,1,1,comparison-interest-rate,What is a comparison interest rate?,"region_canada, region_france, region_mexico, region_thenetherlands, region_northamerica, region_northamericapkg, region_spain, region_unitedkingdom",product_personalloans98k
