"<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This article outlines the key benefits of the Pluto Bank Blance Transfer credit card.</p>
<h3>Article</h3>
<p>With Perpetual Balance Transfer, you can benefit from a lower rate of interest, as compared to the ROI charged on your Credit Card outstanding till the entire transferred balance is paid off.</p>
<p>With the Pluto Balance Transfer Credit Card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest on the transferred balance will be charged at only ""x""% per month, i.e. ""y""% p.a and there is no pre-defined term of this facility.</li>
<li>You only have to make a minimum payment per month which is 5% of the outstanding amount transferred to your card from the other bank/s. You may however choose to pay more each month and close your Balance Transfer earlier, as per your convenience.</li>
<li>In addition to 5% of the transferred amount, you will also have to pay 5% of your Purchase outstanding on your credit card every month which forms part of the minimum payment payable every month.</li>
<li>No pre-payment charges</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things to Consider</h3>
<p>You will not be able to use the credit limit on your Pluto Bank Credit Card for the value of the loan until it is repaid in full or it is closed.</p>
<p>We wish to also inform you the Interest Free period on the card account is not valid for purchases that have Balance Transfer amounts in their credit card account. Also, for all subsequent purchases, cash advances and other outstanding balances, the applicable rate of interest shall be levied and applicable from the date of purchase itself.</p>",,1,1,1,balance-transfer-benefits,Benefits of Balance Transfer,"region_canada, region_france, region_mexico, region_thenetherlands, region_northamerica, region_northamericapkg, region_spain, region_unitedkingdom","product_creditbuilder, product_goldrewards, product_platinumcashback"
"<h3>Balance Transfer on Easy Monthly Installments</h3>
<p>Balance Transfer on EMI is a unique feature that allows you to transfer the outstanding balance from your credit cards to your Pluto credit card and repay it in easy monthly installments at a lower interest rate.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to transfer other credit card outstanding dues for repayment at lower interest rates.</p>
<p>This saves on interest cost during the balance transfer period and flexible repayment options.</p>
<p>It is offered only to select credit card holders, who receive communication by way of Telephone, Email, SMS, etc.</p>","<h3>Balance Transfer on EMI Terms and Conditions</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Balance Transfer on EMI facility allows an Pluto Credit Cardholder (Cardholder) to avail of the Balance Transfer facility on his/her Pluto Credit Card (Card) and repay the same in Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs).</li>
<li>The minimum amount that can be transferred from any other bank credit card account to the Cardholders Pluto Credit Card is 3,000</li>
<li>The Cardholders can choose from multiple tenure options from 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 12 month, 18 month and 24 month</li>
<li>The maximum amount that can be transferred from other bank credit cards to the Cardholder's Pluto Credit Card is up to 90% of the credit limit on the Cardholder's Pluto Credit Card subject to available balance as on the date of approval of the Cardholder's application.If amount requested to be transferred from other bank credit cards to the Cardholder's Pluto Credit Card is greater than 90% of the available credit limit on the Cardholder's Pluto Credit, Balance transfer (Including Interest) will be processed for an amount that equals to 90% of the credit limit. In such scenarios, cashier orders are dispatched to Cardholders Registered mailing address as per record</li>
<li>During the Balance Transfer term, the balance transferred will also be included for computing the minimum payment due, as mentioned in the credit card statement from Pluto</li>
<li>Minimum Amount Due: The Balance Transfer EMI due for the month is included as part of the minimum amount due appearing in the Cardholders monthly statement. The minimum amount due appearing on the Cardholders monthly statement is calculated as a percentage of the total outstanding retail balance + monthly EMI due on Balance Transfer on EMI. Non-payment of the entire total payment due on the credit card by the payment due date will result in the levy of standard credit card interest rates on the balance outstanding. If only minimum amount due (as defined above) is paid, the standard credit card interest rates will be levied on the balance outstanding. However, if such partial payments do not cover the amount of EMI for the month, standard finance charges (including late payment fee) will be levied also</li>
<li>Please note that the payment made will be apportioned as per the payment hierarchy. In case the amount paid does not clear the EMI amount (partly or fully), the remaining EMI amount will be added in the next month's minimum amount due along with standard interest rate charged on the said amount</li>
<li>Kindly note that according to the new payment hierarchy effective from 5 August 2013, the payments will first be apportioned to the extent of minimum payment due, first by the following plans i.e. EMI, cash advances, purchase outstanding and Balance Transfer in descending order of interest rates, and within a given plan, the payment will be allocated in a predefined order of (1) Service charges, (2) Finance charges, (3) Late payment charges, (4) Annual fee and (5) Other fees</li>
